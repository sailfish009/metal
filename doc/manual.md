# Metal {#mainpage}

\tableofcontents

Metal is a header-only C++14 library designed to make metaprogramming easy.
It provides a powerful high-level abstraction for compile-time algorithms that
mimic the Standard Algorithms Library, hence
**Metal** - <b>Meta</b>programming <b>Al</b>gorithms.

There is a myriad of C++ metaprogramming libraries out there so why Metal?

* **Portable** - compatible with the
[most popular compilers](#supported_compilers).
* **Blazing fast** - browse up to date benchmarks at [metaben.ch].
* **SFINAE-Friendly** - [control overload resolution][SFINAE] and make the most
out of function templates.
* **Metaprogramming made easy** - it doesn't have to be hard,
[check it out](#in_a_glimpse)!

Getting Started {#getting_started}
================================================================================

Download {#download}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few ways to get Metal, the easiest might be to simply
[download the latest release][Metal.releases] as a compressed package.

If you have git installed and would rather have the latest stable Metal,
you may consider cloning branch `master` from GitHub.

    git clone https://github.com/brunocodutra/metal

Likewise, the bleeding edge development version can be obtained by cloning
branch `develop` instead.

    git clone https://github.com/brunocodutra/metal --branch=develop

Install (optional) {#install}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metal may optionally be installed system-wide to ease integration with external
projects. If you'd rather use Metal locally, you can skip to the
[next section](#integration).

Make sure to have CMake v3.4 or newer installed on your system, then,
from within an empty directory, issue the following commands.

    cmake /path/to/Metal
    cmake --build . --target install

At this point Metal's include tree will be installed in
`/usr/local/include` on Posix systems and `C:\Program Files\Metal\include`
on Windows.

Integration {#integration}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you chose to [install Metal system-wide](#install), you just have to make
sure the installation prefix is looked up by your compiler.

Using CMake it suffices to add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`.

    find_package(Metal REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${Metal_INCLUDE_DIR})

To use your local copy of Metal instead, just add its `include/` sub-directory
to the include search paths of your project and you are all set.

Supported Compilers {#supported_compilers}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following compilers are tested in continuous integration using
[Travis CI][travis.metal] and [Appveyor CI][appveyor.metal].

| Compiler          | Version
|-------------------|-----------
| GCC               | &ge; 4.8
| Clang             | &ge; 3.4
| Xcode             | &ge; 6.4
| Visual Studio     | &ge; 14 (2015)
| MinGW             | &ge; 5

Project Organization {#project_organization}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Header files are divided in modules named after each [concept](#concepts).
Modules are organized in directories and contain algorithms that operate on
models of that concept. The complete hierarchy of modules and headers is
available on [Metal's repository][Metal.headers] on GitHub.

\tip{
    You may choose to `#include <metal.hpp>` to get access to all that Metal has
    to offer without concerning yourself with which specific headers to include.
}

Concepts {#concepts}
================================================================================

Template metaprogramming may be seen as a language of its own right.
It shares the usual syntax of C++ templates, but has unique semantics.
Because constructs assume different meanings in its context it is useful to
define a few key concepts.

Value {#value}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Values] are the objects of metaprogramming.

### Requirements

Any type is a [Value].

### Examples

\snippet value.cpp val1
\snippet value.cpp val2
\snippet value.cpp val3

### Counterexamples

\snippet value.cpp not_a_val1
\snippet value.cpp not_a_val2
\snippet value.cpp not_a_val3

### See Also

metal::value, metal::is_value

Number {#number}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [Number] is a compile-time representation of a numerical value.

### Requirements

`num` is a model of [Number] if and only if `num` is a specialization of
`metal::number`.

\note{
    `metal::number<n>` is guaranteed to be an alias template to
    `std::integral_constant<metal::int_, n>`.
}

### Examples

\snippet number.cpp num1
\snippet number.cpp num2
\snippet number.cpp num3

### Counterexamples

\snippet number.cpp not_a_num1

### See Also

metal::number, metal::int_

Expression {#expression}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Expressions], also called *metafunctions*, are mappings over the set of
[Values].

### Requirements

`expr` is a model of [Expression] if and only if `expr` is a
class, union or alias template that only expects [Values] as arguments.

### Examples

\snippet expression.cpp  expr1
\snippet expression.cpp  expr2

### Counterexamples

\snippet expression.cpp not_an_expr1
\snippet expression.cpp not_an_expr2

Lambda {#lambda}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Lambdas], short for *Lambda Expressions*, are [first-class][first-class]
[Expressions]. As [Values] themselves, [Lambdas] can serve both as argument as
well as return value to other [Expressions] and [Lambdas],
thus enabling [higher-order] composition.

### Requirements

`lbd` is a model of [Lambda] if and only if `lbd` is a specialization of
`metal::lambda`.

### Examples

\snippet lambda.cpp lbd1

### See Also

metal::lambda, metal::is_lambda

List {#list}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [List] is a sequence of [Values].

### Requirements

`list` is a model of [List] if and only if `list` is a specialization of
`metal::list`.

### Examples

\snippet list.cpp  list1
\snippet list.cpp  list2

### See Also

metal::list, metal::is_list

Pair {#pair}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [Pair] is a couple of [Values].

### Requirements

A [Pair] is any [List] whose size is 2.

### Examples

\snippet pair.cpp  pair1

### See Also

metal::pair, metal::is_pair, metal::first, metal::second

Map {#map}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [Map] is a collection of unique [Values], each of which associated with
another [Value].

### Requirements

A [Map] is a [List] of [Pairs], whose first elements are all distinct, that is

    [[k0, v0], ..., [kn, vn]]; ki != kj for all i, j in {0, n} and i != j

### Examples

\snippet map.cpp  map1
\snippet map.cpp  map2

### Counterexamples

\snippet map.cpp not_a_map1
\snippet map.cpp not_a_map2

### See Also

metal::map, metal::is_map, metal::keys, metal::values

Examples {#examples}
================================================================================

\tip{
    In the following examples, `IS_SAME(X, Y)` is just a terser shorthand for
    `static_assert(std::is_same<X, Y>::value, "")`.
}

Parsing Raw Literals {#parsing_raw_literals}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ever considered augmenting [`std::tuple`][tuple],
so that instead of the rather clunky [`std::get<N>()`][get]

\snippet literal.cpp teaser_1

one could use the more expressive subscript operator `[N]`

\strike{
\snippet literal.cpp teaser_2
}

you might have come up with something like this

\strike{
\snippet literal.cpp naive_1
}

only to realize the hard way that this is simply not valid C++14.

> error: non-type template argument is not a constant expression

While the keyword [`constexpr`][constexpr] tells the compiler the value
returned by `operator []` *might* be a compile time constant, it imposes no
such constraint on its arguments, which may as well be unknown at compile-time.
It might seem we are out of luck at this point, but let us not forget that long
before C++ had `constexpr` variables, integral constants strictly known at
compile time could be expressed with the help of non-type template parameters.

So how about refactoring `operator []` to take an instance of `metal::number`
and relying on template pattern matching to extract its non-type template
argument?

\snippet literal.cpp augmented_tuple

\snippet literal.cpp teaser_3

That looks promising, but then again `metal::number<1>{}` is even clunkier than
`std::get<1>()`, we want something more expressive.

A custom [literal operator][literal.operator] that constructs \numbers out of
integer literals could help reducing the verbosity

\snippet literal.cpp teaser_4

but how is `operator ""_c` implemented?

It might be tempting to try something like this

\strike{
\snippet literal.cpp naive_2
}

but let us not forget the reason why we got this far down the road to begin
with, recall we can't instantiate a template using a non-`constexpr` variable as
argument!

At this point, a watchful reader might argue that in theory there is no real
reason for this to be rejected, since the literal value must always be known at
compile-time and that makes a lot of sense indeed, but unfortunately that's just
not how C++14 works.

All is not lost however, because we can still parse raw literals, in other
words, we are in for some fun!

### The Raw Literal Operator Template

Raw literal operator templates in C++ are defined as a nullary constexpr
function templated over `char...`

\snippet literal.cpp _raw

where `cs...` are mapped to the exact characters that make up the literal,
including the prefixes `0x` and `0b`

\snippet literal.cpp _raw_ex1

as well as digit separators

\snippet literal.cpp _raw_ex2

### The `operator ""_c`

We start by defining the literal operator `_c` as a function that forwards the
raw literal characters as a [List] of [Numbers] to `parse_number` and returns a
default constructed object of whatever type it aliases to, which in this case
is guaranteed to be a [Number].

\snippet literal.cpp _c

### Resolving the Radix

In its turn `parse_number` strips the prefix, if any, thus resolving the radix,
then forwards the remaining characters to `parse_digits`, which is in charge of
translating the raw characters to the numerical values they represent.
The radix and digits are then forwarded to `assemble_number`, which adds up the
individual digits according to the radix.

\snippet literal.cpp parse_number

### Parsing Digits

Before translating characters to their corresponding numerical values, we need
to get rid of all digit separators that may be in the way. To do that we'll use
`metal::remove`, which takes a [List] `l` and a [Value] `val` and returns
another [List] that contains every element in `l` and in the same order,
except for those that are the same as `val`.

\snippet literal.cpp remove

The remaining characters can then be individually parsed with the help of
`metal::transform`, which takes a [Lambda] `lbd` and a [List] `l` and returns
another [List] that contains the \values produced by the invocation of `lbd`
for each element in `l`.

    [lbd(l[0]), lbd(l[1]), ..., lbd(l[n-2]), lbd(l[n-1])]

\snippet literal.cpp parse_digit

\snippet literal.cpp transform

Notice how characters are translated to their actual numerical representation.

Thus we have

\snippet literal.cpp parse_digits

### Assembling Numbers

We now turn to `assemble_number`. It takes a [List] of digits and adds them up
according to the radix, in other words

    D0*radix^(n-1) + D1*radix^(n-2) + ... + D{n-2}*radix + D{n-1}

or, recursively,

    ((...((0*radix + D0)*radix + D1)*...)*radix + D{n-2})*radix + D{n-1}

This is the equivalent of [left folding][fold], or, in the Metal parlance,
`metal::accumulate`, after its run-time counterpart in the standard library.

\snippet literal.cpp accumulate_1

Here we introduced a new [Expression] `expr` from which we created a [Lambda],
but we could also have chosen to use *bind expressions* instead.

\snippet literal.cpp accumulate_2

\note{
    If *bind expressions* look scary to you, don't panic, we will exercise
    [Expression] composition in our [next example](#church_booleans).
    Here it suffices to keep in mind that *bind expressions* return anonymous
    [Lambdas], just like [`std::bind`][bind] returns anonymous functions, and
    that `metal::_1` and `metal::_2` are the equivalents of
    [`std::placeholders::_1` and `std::placeholder::_2`][placeholders].
}

Finally

\snippet literal.cpp assemble_number

### Fun With `operator ""_c`

\snippet literal.cpp _c_ex1

It also works for very long binary literals.

\snippet literal.cpp _c_ex2

And ignores digit separators too.

\snippet literal.cpp _c_ex3

Church Booleans {#church_booleans}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Church Booleans][church] refer to a mathematical framework used to express
logical operation in the context of [lambda notation][lambda_calculus],
where they have an important theoretical significance.
Of less practical importance in C++, even in the context of template
metaprogramming, they will nevertheless help us acquaint with *bind expressions*
in this toy example.

The boolean constants `true_` and `false_` are, by definition, \lambdas that
return respectively the first and second argument with which they are invoked.

\snippet church.cpp bool

That given, we start by defining the logical operator `not_`.
Using the fact that booleans are themselves \lambdas, it is not too hard to
realize that invoking a boolean to `<false_, true>` always yields its negation.

\snippet church.cpp not_expr

To enable higher-order composition we really need `not_` to be a \lambda, not an
\expression. Granted one could easily define it terms of the respective
\expression as `metal::lambda<not_>`, but that would defeat the whole purpose of
this exercise, the idea is to use *bind expressions* directly.

\snippet church.cpp not

Admittedly a little more verbose, but that saves us from introducing a new named
alias template.

To define `and_` and `or_` we'll use the very same technique.

\snippet church.cpp and
\snippet church.cpp or

This exercise might me mind-boggling at first, but you'll get used to it soon
enough.

Without further ado we'll present the logical operator `xor`.

\snippet church.cpp xor

Notice how we *bind* `not_`, which is itself a *bind expression*, which is only
possible due to the fact it is a \lambda.

A Word on SFINAE-Friendliness {#SFINAE}
================================================================================

An [Expression] is said to be SFINAE-friendly when it is carefully designed so
as never to prevent the [SFINAE] rule to be triggered. In general, such
[Expressions] may only trigger template substitution errors at the point of
instantiation of the *signature* of a type, which includes the instantiation of
[alias templates] and default template arguments.

SFINAE-friendly [Expressions] are exceedingly powerful, because they may be used
to drive overload resolution, much like [`std::enable_if`][enable_if] does.
For that reason all [Expressions] within `namespace metal` are guaranteed to be
themselves SFINAE-friendly.

\snippet sfinae.cpp SFINAE

Conversely, an SFINAE-unfriendly [Expression] produces so called *hard errors*,
which require the compilation to halt immediately. Examples of *hard errors*
are failed `static_assert`'ions or template substitution errors at the point of
instantiation of the nested members of a type.

SFINAE-unfriendly [Expressions] are very inconvenient, because they force
compilation to halt when they are not selected by overload resolution, thereby
hindering the usage of the entire overloaded set. For that reason
SFINAE-unfriendly [Expressions] should always be avoided.

Migrating from Boost.MPL {#MPL}
